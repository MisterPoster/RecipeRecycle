RecipeRecycle (February 19, 2020) AJT 2020

Create an app that uses a RecyclerView to display a list of recipes. Each list item must show the name of the recipe with a short description. When the user taps a recipe (an item in the list), start an Activity that shows the full recipe text.

 - Use separate TextView elements and styling for the recipe name and description.
 - You may use placeholder text for the full recipes.
 - As an option, add an image for the finished dish to each recipe.
 - Clicking the Up button takes the user back to the list of recipes.

  - The app had some random recipes not used as part of the formal app requirements.
